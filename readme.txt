A simple plugin to enable integration of the ApexChat service on your website.

== Description ==

ApexChat provides a complete, turnkey chat service. We use our own industry trained live chat agents and software platform to service chats. This means major cost savings as we eliminate the need to take your key employees away from their core responsibilities to handle chats, or hire and train anyone to get started.

ApexChat has you covered 24/7. Weâ€™ve seen on average 42 percent of leads converted via live chat take place after the typical business hours of 9 a.m to 5 p.m. Without around-the-clock coverage you may be missing nearly half the leads you could be getting from your Live Chat provider.

ApexChat charges only for actual qualified leads that are sent to you. There is no minimum recurring charge, or long term contract making ApexChat easy to try. You can cancel our service at any time without any penalty.
